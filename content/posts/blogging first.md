# Obsidian - Why I love it[](https://blog.networkchuck.com/posts/my-insane-blog-pipeline/#obsidian---why-i-love-it)

- Obsidian is the BEST notes application in the world. Go download it: [https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/)

## The Setup[](https://blog.networkchuck.com/posts/my-insane-blog-pipeline/#the-setup)

- Create a new folder labeled _posts_. This is where you will add your blog posts
- ….that’s all you have to do
- Actually…wait….find out where your Obsidian directories are. Right click your _posts_ folder and choose _show in system explorer_
- You’ll need this directory in upcoming steps.
